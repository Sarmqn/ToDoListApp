# ToDoListApp

This is the 2nd Project I have created, which will be entered into my portfolio of projects.

The aim of this project is to create a To Do List Application that will run off of using the Command-Line Tool. It will help allow users to manage their daily tasks. The app will save the tasks within a text file, that will be reopened when the app is reopened which saves the progress.

### Features for the app:

- Addition tasks.
- Viewing of all tasks.
- Indictators for completed tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Save tasks to a file for future use.
- Load tasks from a saved file.
